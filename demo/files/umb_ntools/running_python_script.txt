IMPORTANT NOTES: 
•	The JavaScript code assumes that all the needed files are located within the same directory, therefore, the .json and .nii files should be in the same directory
•	The output directory is currently set to  ../{subject}/{subject}_default_labels.nii and ../{subject}/{subject}_{seizType}_labels.nii which means the output will be in a subject folder located in the parent directory of umb_ntools. 
•	The Python script should be run before using the visualization tools in n-tools
•	Remember to select NYU mode on n-tools and enter in the subject ID

Running the Script
1. Navigate to the umb_ntools folder on your local system
2. Run the script by using the python or python3 command providing the following as arguments on the command line. 
	1st command-line argument: SubjectID
	2nd command-line argument: Path to .json
	3rd command-line argument: Path to .nii
